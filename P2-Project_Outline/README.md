## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Find My Coffee will do as its name suggests: this app is designed to display all specialty coffee shops within your determined area with preference on what’s closest and what you’re in the mood for. Are you wanting a bakery selection or a minimalist menu? Are you in the mood for a seasonal beverage or pour-over? With our selection filters, finding a coffee shop can prove to be easier than searching the internet for your answers. Often, we find ourselves sifting through Yelp or Google for a reputable cafe with our tastes in mind. 

Being built by baristas, this app will narrow your options and simplify your search by those with an ear to the ground. By focusing on local specialty coffee shops, you’ll be able to have a more individualized experience knowing that your needs for elevated coffee will be met while supporting Saint Louis businesses. The app will have a “near me” map feature, a social media links page, an information page, and a clock function to ensure the user won’t be tempted to visit a cafe that’s closed. The goal is to make the search for a cafe simpler, so you won’t spend needless time figuring out what you’re in the mood for. 

### Features

List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:
1) User Authentication: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the app. Each user will have a profile page with their preferences.
2) Search: Users will be able to search for cafe information containing given text.
3) Filter Results: Users will be able to select their preferences for coffee shop criteria such as: breakfast items, ample seating, or open late.
